Day 1-2: Introduction to Python

**Basics of Python Syntax** - Python is known for its readability and simplicity. It uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces, making it visually clean. Commands are written in plain English, making it beginner-friendly.

**Variables and Data Types** - Variables are containers for storing data. Python supports various data types like integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers), and strings (text). Understanding data types is crucial for efficient programming.

**Control Flow (if statements, loops)** - Control flow dictates the order in which your program executes. 'if' statements allow you to make decisions based on conditions, while loops let you repeat actions. These are fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive programs.

**Task:**
Write a Python program that simulates a chemical reaction. Use variables to represent reactants and products and incorporate control flow to manage different reaction conditions.

**Summary of Day 1-2:**
You've laid the foundation by understanding the basic syntax of Python. You can now create simple programs, use variables to store information, and control the flow of your code with conditional statements and loops.

Day 3-4: Functions and Modules

**Defining and Calling Functions** - Functions are blocks of reusable code. You define them using the 'def' keyword, give them a name, and can execute them by calling their name. Functions improve code organization and readability.

**Modules and Importing** - Modules are Python files containing functions and variables. You can import these modules into your program to use their functionality. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.

**Understanding Scope** - Scope defines the visibility of variables. Variables defined inside a function are local to that function, while those outside functions are global. Understanding scope helps prevent naming conflicts and enhances code clarity.

**Task:**
Create a Python function that calculates the molar mass of a chemical compound. Use a module to import atomic mass data and demonstrate the use of local and global variables.

**Summary of Day 3-4:**
You've delved into the world of functions, understanding how to create, call, and organize code into reusable blocks. Additionally, you've explored modules, learning how to import external code into your programs.

---

Day 5-6: Data Structures

**Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries** - Lists are ordered collections of items, tuples are immutable ordered collections, and dictionaries are key-value pairs. These data structures help you organize and manipulate data efficiently.

**String Manipulation** - Strings are sequences of characters. Python provides powerful string manipulation methods, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting, allowing you to work with textual data effectively.

**List Comprehensions** - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They are a Pythonic way to generate lists using a single line of code, making your programs more readable and efficient.

**Task:**
Represent a DNA sequence in Python using a combination of lists and strings. Use list comprehensions to identify and extract specific nucleotide sequences.

**Summary of Day 5-6:**
You now have a grasp of fundamental data structures in Python. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries enable you to manage and manipulate data, and string manipulation adds versatility to working with textual information.

Day 7: Exception Handling

**Handling Errors with Try-Except Blocks** - In programming, errors are common. 'try' and 'except' blocks allow you to handle errors gracefully, preventing your program from crashing. This ensures a smoother user experience and helps in debugging.

**Raising Exceptions** - You can intentionally raise exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional situations in your code. This is a proactive way to handle potential issues and guide the flow of your program.

**Task:**
Write a Python program that simulates a medical diagnostic process. Use try-except blocks to handle unexpected input and raise exceptions for specific diagnostic conditions.

**Summary of Day 7:**
You've learned how to handle errors effectively using try-except blocks and how to raise exceptions when needed. This is crucial for writing robust programs that can gracefully recover from unexpected situations.

Day 8-9: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Classes and Objects** - In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and can have attributes (characteristics) and methods (functions). This paradigm helps in organizing code and modeling real-world entities.

**Inheritance and Polymorphism** - Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism enables objects to take on multiple forms, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

**Encapsulation and Abstraction** - Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential properties, hiding unnecessary details.

**Task:**
Create a Python program that models different types of medical imaging equipment. Use classes and inheritance to represent common functionalities, and demonstrate polymorphism in handling various imaging modalities.

**Summary of Day 8-9:**
You've entered the realm of Object-Oriented Programming, understanding how to create classes, utilize inheritance and polymorphism, and apply encapsulation and abstraction for efficient code organization.

Day 10-11: File Handling

**Reading and Writing to Files** - File handling allows your programs to interact with external files. 'open()' function is used to read or write data to files. Understanding file operations is crucial for working with external data.

**Working with Different File Formats (Text, CSV, JSON)** - Python supports various file formats. Understanding how to read and write data in formats like text, CSV, and JSON expands your ability to work with diverse datasets.

**Task:**
Develop a Python program that reads patient data from a CSV file, performs basic analysis, and then writes the results to a new JSON file. This simulates processing and transforming medical data.

**Summary of Day 10-11:**
You've acquired skills in handling external files, a crucial aspect of real-world programming. Now you can read and write data, opening doors to working with different file formats commonly encountered in the industry.

Day 11-12: Introduction to Libraries and Frameworks

**Overview of Popular Libraries (NumPy, Pandas)** - Libraries are pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks. NumPy is for numerical operations, and Pandas is for data manipulation and analysis. Familiarity with these libraries is valuable for data-related tasks.

**Basics of Web Frameworks (Flask, Django)** - Web frameworks provide tools and structure to build web applications. Flask is lightweight and flexible, while Django is a more comprehensive framework. Understanding their basics is essential for web development.

**Task:**
Imagine you're working in a pharmaceutical research lab. Use NumPy to simulate the results of an experiment involving drug dosage. Then, use Pandas to analyze and visualize the data. Additionally, create a simple web application using Flask that displays the experiment results.

**Summary of Day 11-12:**
You've been introduced to powerful Python libraries and frameworks. NumPy and Pandas open avenues for data manipulation, while Flask provides a foundation for web development.

Day 13: Mini Project

**Project:**
Develop a Python program that models a medical records system. Use classes to represent patients, incorporating attributes like name, age, and medical history. Implement methods for updating records and generating reports. Utilize Pandas to manage the data efficiently.

**Summary of Day 13:**
Congratulations! You've reached the mini-project stage. This practical application allows you to integrate all the concepts learned so far, creating a comprehensive medical records system using object-oriented programming and data manipulation with Pandas.

Day 14: Mini Project Review

**Task:**
Review your mini project code. Identify areas where you can optimize and refactor your code. Consider incorporating exception handling for potential errors in user input or file operations. Additionally, explore ways to enhance the user interface or data presentation in your medical records system.

**Summary of Day 14:**
In the final day, you'll review and refine your mini project. This step encourages you to reflect on your code, apply improvements, and consider how you can make your program more robust and user-friendly. It marks the completion of the two-week intensive Python journey, focusing on practical application and continuous improvement.
